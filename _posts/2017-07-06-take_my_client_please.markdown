I'm an online marketing consultant specializing in lead-gen, online promotions, and organic / paid social. I've worked and freelanced at several agencies of all sizes.

I regularly utilize an *array* of marketing skills, from copywriting and straightforward design solutions to whatever is necessary to fulfil a client request. When it comes to providing website edits and updates, I've been able to teach myself what's necessary and it has allowed me to deliver for the client, thus far.

This opportunity to evolve and expand my skill set has made me realize how important it is to be able to fully serve a client's web development needs. Referring the project to someone else runs the risk of sending them elsewhere to be courted by a full-service shop. Subcontracting out can sometimes be more work than it's worth. Additionally, dev skills are going to be a necessary skill in the very near future, so it's another reason to dive into this program. 

If you're a freelancer or consultant, one day, you may be presented an opportunity to solve a technical problem for a client. One option is to refer them to a great dev you know and hope that they're not a killer [wordsmith / graphic designer / insert your service here]. Or since you've just graduated from the Flatiron School program, you could take that project on, add it to your portfolio and keep a client happy.
